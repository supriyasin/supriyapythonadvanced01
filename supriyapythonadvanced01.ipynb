    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Like other general-purpose programming languages, Python is also an object-oriented language since its beginning. \n",
    "   It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach. In Python, we can easily create and use \n",
    "   classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "   An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-word \n",
    "   entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a widespread \n",
    "   technique to solve the problem by creating objects.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    . Class\n",
    "    . Object\n",
    "    . Method\n",
    "    . Inheritance\n",
    "    . Polymorphism\n",
    "    . Data Abstraction\n",
    "    . Encapsulation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Class:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods. \n",
    "  For example: if you have an employee class, then it should contain an attribute and method, i.e. \n",
    "  an email id, name, age, salary, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "    class ClassName:     \n",
    "            <statement-1>     \n",
    "            .     \n",
    "            .      \n",
    "            <statement-N> \n",
    "            \n",
    "    Object:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  The object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, \n",
    "  chair, table, pen, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes and methods. All functions have a \n",
    "  built-in attribute __doc__, which returns the docstring defined in the function source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When we define a class, it needs to create an object to allocate the memory. Consider the following example.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class car:  \n",
    "        def __init__(self,modelname, year):  \n",
    "            self.modelname = modelname  \n",
    "            self.year = year  \n",
    "        def display(self):  \n",
    "            print(self.modelname,self.year)  \n",
    "      \n",
    "    c1 = car(\"Toyota\", 2016)  \n",
    "    c1.display()  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Toyota 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the above example, we have created the class named car, and it has two attributes modelname and year. \n",
    "   We have created a c1 object to access the class attribute. The c1 object will allocate memory for these values.\n",
    "   We will learn more about class and object in the next tutorial.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Method:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  The method is a function that is associated with an object. In Python, a method is not unique to class instances. \n",
    "  Any object type can have methods.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Inheritance:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  Inheritance is the most important aspect of object-oriented programming, which simulates the real-world concept \n",
    "  of inheritance. It specifies that the child object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  By using inheritance, we can create a class which uses all the properties and behavior of another class. The new \n",
    "  class is known as a derived class or child class, and the one whose properties are acquired is known as a base class \n",
    "  or parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It provides the re-usability of the code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Polymorphism:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  Polymorphism contains two words \"poly\" and \"morphs\". Poly means many, and morph means shape. By polymorphism, \n",
    "  we understand that one task can be performed in different ways. For example - you have a class animal, and all \n",
    "  animals speak. But they speak differently. Here, the \"speak\" behavior is polymorphic in a sense and depends on \n",
    "  the animal. So, the abstract \"animal\" concept does not actually \"speak\", but specific animals (like dogs and cats) \n",
    "  have a concrete implementation of the action \"speak\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Encapsulation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  Encapsulation is also an essential aspect of object-oriented programming. It is used to restrict access to methods \n",
    "  and variables. In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Data Abstraction:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  Data abstraction and encapsulation both are often used as synonyms. Both are nearly synonyms because data abstraction \n",
    "  is achieved through encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities. Abstracting something means to give names \n",
    "  to things so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Object-oriented vs. Procedure-oriented Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "  The difference between object-oriented and procedure-oriented programming is given below:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Index \tObject-oriented Programming \tProcedural Programming\n",
    "  1. \tObject-oriented programming is the problem-solving approach and used where computation is done by using \n",
    "        objects. \tProcedural programming uses a list of instructions to do computation step by step.\n",
    "  2. \tIt makes the development and maintenance easier. \tIn procedural programming, It is not easy to \n",
    "        maintain the codes when the project becomes lengthy.\n",
    "  3. \tIt simulates the real world entity. So real-world problems can be easily solved through oops. \tIt doesn't simulate \n",
    "        the real world. It works on step by step instructions divided into small parts called functions.\n",
    "  4. \tIt provides data hiding. So it is more secure than procedural languages. You cannot access private data \n",
    "        from anywhere. \tProcedural language doesn't provide any proper way for data binding, so it is less secure.\n",
    "  5. \tExample of object-oriented programming languages is C++, Java, .Net, Python, C#, etc. \tExample of procedural \n",
    "        languages are: C, Fortran, Pascal, VB etc.\"\"\"\n",

    "#Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The good news is that OOP is much simpler to understand and use in Python than in other languages, such as C++ or Java. \n",
    "   As a dynamically typed scripting language, Python removes much of the syntactic clutter and complexity that clouds OOP \n",
    "   in other tools. In fact, most of the OOP story in Python boils down to this expression: object.attribute\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We've been using this expression throughout the book to access module attributes, call methods of objects, and so on. \n",
    "   When we say this to an object that is derived from a class statement, however, the expression kicks off a search in \n",
    "   Python—it searches a tree of linked objects, looking for the first appearance of attribute that it can find. When \n",
    "   classes are involved, the preceding Python expression effectively translates to the following in natural language:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Find the first occurrence of attribute by looking in object, then in all classes above it, from bottom to top and \n",
    "   left to right.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In other words, attribute fetches are simply tree searches. The term inheritance is applied because objects lower \n",
    "   in a tree inherit attributes attached to objects higher in that tree. As the search proceeds from the bottom up, \n",
    "   in a sense, the objects linked into a tree are the union of all the attributes defined in all their tree parents, \n",
    "   all the way up the tree.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In Python, this is all very literal: we really do build up trees of linked objects with code, and Python really \n",
    "   does climb this tree at runtime searching for attributes every time we use the object. attribute expression. To make \n",
    "   this more concrete, Figure 25-1 sketches an example of one of these trees.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In this figure, there is a tree of five objects labeled with variables, all of which have attached attributes, ready \n",
    "   to be searched. More specifically, this tree links together three\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "  Serve as instance factories. Their attributes provide behavior—data and functions—that is inherited by all the instances \n",
    "  generated from them (e.g., a function to compute an employee's salary from pay and hours). Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "  Represent the concrete items in a program's domain. Their attributes record data that varies per specific object \n",
    "  (e.g., an employee's Social Security number).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In terms of search trees, an instance inherits attributes from its class, and a class inherits attributes from all \n",
    "  classes above it in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Figure 25-1, we can further categorize the ovals by their relative positions in the tree. We usually call classes\n",
    "  higher in the tree (like C2 and C3) superclasses; classes lower in the tree (like Cl) are known as subclasses.* These \n",
    "  terms refer to relative tree positions and roles. Superclasses provide behavior shared by all their subclasses, but \n",
    "  because the search proceeds from the bottom up, subclasses may override behavior defined in their superclasses by \n",
    "  redefining superclass names lower in the tree.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  As these last few words are really the crux of the matter of software customization in OOP, let's expand on this \n",
    "  concept. Suppose we build up the tree in Figure 25-1, and then say this: I2.w\n",
    "\n",
    " *In other literature, you may also occasionally see the terms base classes and derived classes used to describe \n",
    "  superclasses and subclasses, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    " Right away, this code invokes inheritance. Because this is an object.attribute expression, it triggers a search \n",
    " of the tree in Figure 25-1—Python will search for the attribute w by looking in I2 and above. Specifically, it will \n",
    " search the linked objects in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    " and stop at the first attached w it finds (or raise an error if w isn't found at all). In this case, w won't be \n",
    " found until C3 is searched because it appears only in that object. In other words, I2.w resolves to C3.w by virtue \n",
    " of the automatic search. In OOP terminology, I2 \"inherits\" the attribute w from C3.\n",
    " \n",
    "   Ultimately, the two instances inherit four attributes from their classes: w, x, y, and z. Other attribute \n",
    "   references will wind up following different paths in the tree. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  • Il.x and I2.x both find x in Cl and stop because Cl is lower than C2.\n",
    "\n",
    "  • Il.y and I2.y both find y in Cl because that's the only place y appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "  • Il.z and I2.z both find z in C2 because C2 is further to the left than C3.\n",
    "\n",
    "  • I2.name finds name in I2 without climbing the tree at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Trace these searches through the tree in Figure 25-1 to get a feel for how inheritance searches work in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The first item in the preceding list is perhaps the most important to notice—because Cl redefines the attribute x \n",
    "  lower in the tree, it effectively replaces the version above it in C2. As you'll see in a moment, such redefinitions \n",
    "  are at the heart of software customization in OOP—by redefining and replacing the attribute, Cl effectively customizes \n",
    "  what it inherits from its superclasses.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Python is an object-oriented programming language that supports the creation of classes and objects. \n",
    "   Understanding the difference between class objects and instance objects is essential for creating effective \n",
    "   Python code. In this tutorial, we will study the difference between class objects and instance objects in Python. \n",
    "   Before proceeding you must read what is Object-Oriented Programming and what are classes. There are two types of \n",
    "   objects in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    . class objects\n",
    "    . instance objects\n",
    "    \n",
    "   What is a Class Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Python, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that \n",
    "  the objects of that class will have. A class object is an object that represents the class itself, rather than \n",
    "  an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When we define a class in Python, we create a class object that can be used to create instances of that class. \n",
    "  The class object can be accessed using the name of the class followed by the dot operator.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Here’s an example of defining a class in Python:\n",
    "  1\n",
    "  2\n",
    "  3\n",
    "  4\n",
    "  5\n",
    "  \t\n",
    "  class Car:\n",
    "      wheels = 4\n",
    " \n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The car has started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this example, we define a class named “Car” with a class attribute “wheels” and a class method “start”. \n",
    "  The “wheels” attribute is a class-level attribute, meaning that it’s shared among all instances of the class. \n",
    "  The “start” method is a class-level method, meaning that it can be called on the class itself, rather than on an \n",
    "  instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To create an instance of the “Car” class, we can use the class object to call the constructor of the class:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1\n",
    "  \t\n",
    "  my_car = Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this example, we create an instance of the “Car” class named “my_car”. The instance object has its own copy \n",
    "  of the class attribute “wheels”, which can be accessed using the dot operator:\n",
    "  1\n",
    "\t\n",
    "  print(my_car.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "  \n",
    "  What is an Instance Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "  An instance object is an object that is created from a class. Each instance of a class has its own set of attributes \n",
    "  and methods that are independent of other instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In the previous example, we created an instance object of the “Car” class named “my_car”. This instance object \n",
    "  has its own copy of the “wheels” attribute, which can be accessed using the dot operator:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1\n",
    "\t\n",
    "  print(my_car.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "  We can also create multiple instances of the “Car” class with different values for the “wheels” attribute:\n",
    "  1\n",
    "  2\n",
    "  3\n",
    "  4\n",
    "  5\n",
    "  \t\n",
    "  my_other_car = Car()\n",
    "  my_other_car.wheels = 6\n",
    " \n",
    "  print(my_other_car.wheels)  # Output: 6\n",
    "  print(my_car.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this example, we create another instance of the “Car” class named “my_other_car”. This instance object has its \n",
    "  own copy of the “wheels” attribute, which we set to 6. The “my_car” instance object still has its own copy of the \n",
    "  “wheels” attribute, which remains 4.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Differences between Class Objects and Instance Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "  The main difference between class objects and instance objects in Python is that class objects represent the class \n",
    "  itself, while instance objects represent individual instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Another difference is that class objects can have class-level attributes and methods that are shared among all instances \n",
    "  of the class, while instance objects have their own set of attributes and methods that are independent of other instances \n",
    "  of the same class.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Here’s a summary of the differences between class objects and instance objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class objects represent the class itself, while instance objects represent individual instances of the class.\n",
    "    Class objects can have class-level attributes and methods that are shared among all instances of the class, \n",
    "    while instance objects have their own set of attributes and methods that are independent of other\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now we will discuss one by one in detail with examples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class object:\n",
    "\n",
    "  when we create a class in python then a class object is created so whenever python finds a class statement in \n",
    "  the whole program then it creates a class object and assigns a name to that object i.e. class name. As we know in \n",
    "  python, everything is an object so the class itself is an object and is the instance of metaclasses. Look at the \n",
    "  following example\n",
    "  1\n",
    "  2\n",
    "  \t\n",
    "  class MyClass:\n",
    "   pass\n",
    "\n",
    "  above code will generate a class object and name it ‘MyClass’. From this class object, we will create instance objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Class objects provide default behavior and serve as factories for instance objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  the class object comes from the ‘class’ statement in code. whenever we encounter a class statement then a class \n",
    "  object will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "  class object inherits the attributes of its parent classes.\n",
    "  Instance object:\n",
    "\n",
    "  when we call a class, it creates an instance object of that class from which the object has been created. \n",
    "  For example when we call the above-created class then it will create an instance object like this.\n",
    "  1\n",
    "  \t\n",
    "  Obj1=MyClass()\n",
    "\n",
    "  the above statement creates an object and names it to Obj1 which is an instance of MyClass.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Instance objects are real objects in your python code process. The instance object has access to attributes of \n",
    "  the class from which it is created. For example, Obj1 is the instance of class MyClass so, Now Obj1 can access \n",
    "  everything defined in the class, and in the class object, we define the default behavior and properties of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The instance object comes from a call i.e. when we call the class. Actually, we are creating instance objects of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  instance object inherits the attributes of the class object from which it was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    class object is like a blueprint for intance object but instance object is a concrete item in out code.\n",
    "    instance objects are new namespaces, thay start out empty but inherit object attributes that live in class object.\n",
    "    The first argumetn of class functions(self) reference the instance object and assignments to attributes of self change \n",
    "    data in the instance.\"\"\"\n",

    "#Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"What is the use of Self in Python?\n",
    "  Python - self in python - edureka\n",
    "\n",
    "  The self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and \n",

    "    A class is like a blueprint with variables/ attributes and functions/ methods declared. To use the class, we \n",
    "    need to create objects for the created class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Using the objects, we can call the methods in the class and access the declared attributes.\n",
    "    Every object can have its values for the attributes in the class. We can pass the values we want as arguments \n",
    "    when creating the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here is a simple example of a class and an object:\n",
    "   \n",
    "       class planet:  \n",
    "        var1 = \"Planet\"  \n",
    "        var2 = \"Solar system\"  \n",

    "    print (earth. var2)  \n",
    "    earth. function ()  \n",

    "  Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "  We created a class named planet. In the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We declared two variables, var1 and var2.\n",
    "    We created a function where we printed two strings with the declared variables inside the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "  Now, what is self in the class?\n",
    "\n",
    "  When we create an object for the class and call the function, the self is replaced with the created object. \n",
    "  It is like a placeholder for the object. In the class we created, we have two variables common to all the objects \n",

    "\n",
    "#Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"You can use classes to hold class (or shared) attributes or to create class instances. To create an instance of a \n",
    "   class, you call the class as if it were a function. For example, consider the following class:\n",
    "\n",
    "  class MyClass:\n",
    "      pass\n",
    "      \n",
    "  Here, the pass statement is used because a statement is required to complete the class, but no action is required \n",
    "  programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The following statement creates an instance of the class MyClass:\n",
    "\n",
    "  x = MyClass()\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"We have already discussed in previous tutorial, a class is a virtual entity and can be seen as a blueprint of \n",
    "   an object. The class came into existence when it instantiated. Let's understand it by an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Suppose a class is a prototype of a building. A building contains all the details about the floor, rooms, doors,\n",
    "  windows, etc. we can make as many buildings as we want, based on these details. Hence, the building can be seen as \n",
    "  a class, and we can create as many objects of this class.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  On the other hand, the object is the instance of a class. The process of creating an object can be called instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this section of the tutorial, we will discuss creating classes and objects in Python. We will also discuss how a class \n",
    "  attribute is accessed by using the object.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Creating Classes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Python, a class can be created by using the keyword class, followed by the class name. The syntax to create \n",
    "  a class is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "      class ClassName:    \n",
    "          #statement_suite \n",
    "          \n",
    "    In Python, we must notice that each class is associated with a documentation string which can be accessed by \n",
    "    using <class-name>.__doc__. A class contains a statement suite including fields, constructor, function, etc. definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Consider the following example to create a class Employee which contains two fields as Employee id, and name.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The class also contains a function display(), which is used to display the information of the Employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example\n",
    "  \n",
    "      class Employee:    \n",
    "        id = 10   \n",
    "        name = \"Devansh\"    \n",
    "        def display (self):    \n",
    "            print(self.id,self.name)    \n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, the self is used as a reference variable, which refers to the current class object. It is always the first \n",
    "  argument in the function definition. However, using self is optional in the function call.\n",
    "  The self-parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "  The self-parameter refers to the current instance of the class and accesses the class variables. We can use anything \n",
    "  \n",
    "  instead of self, but it must be the first parameter of any function which belongs to the class.\n",
    "  Creating Objects (instance) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "  A class needs to be instantiated if we want to use the class attributes in another class or method. A class can be \n",
    "  instantiated by calling the class using the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The syntax to create the instance of the class is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <object-name> = <class-name>(<arguments>)    \n",
    "\n",
    "  The following example creates the instance of the class Employee defined in the above example.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Employee:    \n",
    "        id = 10   \n",
    "        name = \"John\"    \n",
    "        def display (self):    \n",
    "            print(\"ID: %d \\nName: %s\"%(self.id,self.name))    \n",
    "    # Creating a emp instance of Employee class  \n",
    "    emp = Employee()    \n",
    "    emp.display()    \n",
    "\n",
    "  Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ID: 10 \n",
    "  Name: Natasha\n",
    "\n",
    "  In the above code, we have created the Employee class which has two attributes named id and name and assigned \n",
    "  value to them. We can observe we have passed the self as parameter in display function. It is used to refer to\n",
    "  the same class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We have created a new instance object named emp. By using it, we can access the attributes of the class.\n",
    "  Delete the Object\n",
    "\n",
    "  We can delete the properties of the object or object itself by using the del keyword. Consider the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Employee:  \n",
    "        id = 10  \n",

    "   \n",

    "   Inheritance is the property of an OOP language through which the data and behavior of a superclass can be passed \n",
